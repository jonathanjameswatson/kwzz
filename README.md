<h4 align="center">A new quiz website built to help people create, share and play quizzes.</h4>

With kwzz, quizzes can be made quickly and easily and shared so that anyone play them and test their knowledge. Once a user has played a quiz, they can easily review their results and recieve feedback on the topics they did poorly on. Creators of quizzes can also review attempts to their quizzes to see how others do at them.
